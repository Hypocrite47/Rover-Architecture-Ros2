# Rover-Architecture-Ros2
# URC Rover System - ROS2 Jazzy
A Basic ROS2 implementation simulating (URC) 2026 missions using Turtlesim.

(UPDATE      : STUCK AT STARTING FIXED)

(NEW ISSUE   : FREEZES AT 2nd WAYPOINT)

---
## System Overview

This project simulates a Mars rover completing four mission types:
1. **Science Mission**: Navigate to sites, capture images with GNSS data.
2. **Delivery Mission**: Pick and deliver objects using action servers.
3. **Equipment Servicing**: Maintenance tasks at equipment locations.
4. **Autonomous Navigation**: Visit 4 waypoints (2 GNSS, 2 Vision-based).

---

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04
- **ROS2**: Jazzy Jalisco
- **Python**: 3.10+
- **Hardware**: Webcam (optional - uses dummy camera if not available)

---
## HOW TO USE ?

1. Download the repository as Zip or  Use the command below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hypocrite47/urc_rover_ws.git
```

2. Navigate to the workspace
```bash
cd urc_rover_ws
```
3. Build the workspace
```bash
colcon build
```
4. Source the workspace
After building, source the local setup file so ROS 2 can find your packages:

```bash
source install/setup.bash
```

## Running Missions

### Science Mission

```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch urc_rover science_mission.launch.py
```

**What it does:**
```
- Turtle navigates to 3 geological sites
- Captures images at each location
- Records GNSS coordinates
- Saves data to `data/images/`
```
**Expected Output:**
```
[science_mission]: Starting Science Mission...
[science_mission]: --- Visiting Site_Alpha ---
[navigation_controller]: Going to (2.0, 2.0)
[science_mission]: Arrived at Site_Alpha!
[camera_handler]: Saved: site01.jpg
```

### Autonomous Navigation
```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch urc_rover autonomous_nav.launch.py
```

**What it does:**
```
- Visits 4 waypoints autonomously
- 2 GNSS-based waypoints
- 2 Vision-based targets
- LED indicator changes (Redâ†’Greenâ†’Red)
```

**Expected Output:**
```
LED STATUS: AUTONOMOUS (Red)
[autonomous_nav]: Waypoint 1/4: GNSS_Point_1
[autonomous_nav]: Reached GNSS_Point_1!
LED STATUS: TARGET_REACHED (Green)
```

### Servicing Mission
Terminal 01
```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch urc_rover rover_system.launch.py mission_mode:=servicing
```
Terminal 02
```bash
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run urc_rover servicing_mission
```

**What it does:**
```
- Services 3 equipment locations
- Shows maintenance tasks being performed
```


### Delivery Mission
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start system
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch urc_rover rover_system.launch.py mission_mode:=delivery

# Terminal 2: Run delivery
source install/setup.bash
ros2 run urc_rover delivery_mission
```

**What it does:**
```
- Navigates to pickup location
- Picks up package
- Delivers to destination
- Uses ROS2 Action Server/Client
```
